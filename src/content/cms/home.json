This book helps you learn the Kotlin language with a unique method that goes beyond syntax and how-to manuals, and teaches you how to think like a great Kotlin developer. Despite its playful appearance, it's serious stuff. You'll learn everything from language fundamentals, through to collections, generics, lambdas and higher-order functions. And along the way, you'll get to play with both object-oriented and functional programming. If you want to really understand Kotlin, this is the book for you.\n\n### Why does this book look so different?\n\nBased on the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory, Head First Kotlin uses a visually rich format to engage your mind, rather than a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. Why waste your time struggling with new concepts? This multi-sensory learning experience is designed for the way your brain really works.\n",
