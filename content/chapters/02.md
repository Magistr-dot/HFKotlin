## There’s one thing all code depends on—variables 
So in this chapter, we’re going to look under the hood, and show you how **Kotlin variables really work**. You’ll discover Kotlin’s **basic types**, such as *Ints*, *Floats* and *Booleans*, and learn how the Kotlin compiler can **cleverly infer a variable’s type from the value it’s given**. You’ll find out how to use **String templates** to construct complex Strings with very little code, and you’ll learn how to create **arrays** to hold multiple values. Finally, you’ll discover *why objects are so important to life in Kotlinville*.
