## Everybody likes code that’s consistent 
And one way of writing consistent code that’s less prone to problems is to use generics. In this chapter, we’ll look at how Kotlin’s collection classes use generics to stop you from putting a Cabbage into a List<Seagull>. You’ll discover when and how to write your own generic classes, interfaces and functions, and how to restrict a generic type to a specific supertype. Finally, you’ll find out how to use covariance and contravariance, putting YOU in control of your generic type’s behavior.
