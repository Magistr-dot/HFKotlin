## Everybody wants to write code that’s safe 
And the great news is that Kotlin was designed with code-safety at its heart. We’ll start by showing you how Kotlin’s use of nullable types means that you’ll hardly ever experience a NullPointerException during your entire stay in Kotlinville. You’ll discover how to make safe calls, and how Kotlin’s Elvis operator stops you being all shook up. And when we’re done with nulls, you’ll find out how to throw and catch exceptions like a pro.
