## Kotlin has an entire host of built-in higher-order functions 
And in this chapter, we’ll introduce you to some of the most useful ones. You’ll meet the flexible filter family, and discover how they can help you trim your collection down to size. You’ll learn how to transform a collection using map, loop through its items with forEach, and how to group the items in your collection using groupBy. You’ll even use fold to perform complex calculations using just one line of code. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to write code more powerful than you ever thought possible.
