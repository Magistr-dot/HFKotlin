## Want to write code that’s even more powerful and flexible 
If so, then you need lambdas. A lambda—or lambda expression—is a block of code that you can pass round just like an object. Here, you’ll discover how to define a lambda, assign it to a variable, and then execute its code. You’ll learn about function types, and how these can help you write higher-order functions that use lambdas for their parameter or return values. And along the way, you’ll find out how a little syntactic sugar can make your coding life sweeter.
